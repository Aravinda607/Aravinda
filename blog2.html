            computer.

            <b>1.What is a Computer system?</b> <br /><br />
            The computer system is an assortment of three different entities
            that are designed to receive, process, manage and present
            information in a significant arrangement. Hardware, Software, and
            Liveware are the three entities working together to form a single
            computer system. A Computer system might be either Analog, Digital,
            or Hybrid. These computer system architectures developed over the
            years. Von Neumann architecture was the most effective invention in
            computer system architecture and is still used in most computers
            produced today. <br />
            <br />
            <b>2.Von Neumann Architecture Model</b> <br />
            <br />
            The Von Neumann design is about the construction that a computer
            ought to follow. John Louise von Neumann is a popular mathematician
            who composed the first draft of a report on EDVAC. EDVAC is one of
            the first electronic computers. Von Neumann is the innovator of the
            merge sort algorithm, wherein the part of an array is sorted and
            merge. He made a significant commitment to the utilization of memory
            to store data in a digital computer. The majority of computers
            follow this structure. A Von Neumann-based computer has the
            following accompanying qualities: <br />
          </p>

          <p style="margin-left: 35px">• Uses a solitary processor <br /></p>

          <p style="margin-left: 35px">
            • Uses one memory for both Data and instruction
            <br />
            • Carries out programs by executing one instruction at a time.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Von Neumann architecture is a stored-program computer concept, where
            instruction data and program data are stored in the same memory. In
            von Neumann architecture control unit recovers data and instruction
            in a similar way from one memory. Design and advancement of the
            control unit are simplified, less expensive, and quicker. Data from
            input/output devices and memory are received in a similar way.
            Association of memory is finished by programmers which permits them
            to use the memory’s entire limit.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Von Neumann architecture design comprises four main subsystems.
            Four main subsystems:

            <b>3.Four Main Subsystems</b><br /><br />
            Von Neumann architecture is a theoretical design for a computer
            framework, which has gotten the “standard” design for practically
            advanced computers. A Von Neumann computer has four fundamental
            subsystems to it: a central processing unit, some approach to do
            input unit and output unit, and a memory unit. <br /><br />
            <b>Central Processing Unit </b>has three components: ALU, CU, and
            Registers. <br />
            <u>The arithmetic logic unit </u>is responsible for performing
            actual calculations, basic arithmetic, and comparison operations.
            The ALU contains some number of registers, exceptionally quick
            memory areas that are alluded by unique names, instead of addresses.
            New computers have up to a few hundred registers, with 16 through 64
            allocated to the ALU. At the point when the ALU plays out a
            calculation, all its sub-circuits work on the input data, which is
            replicated from a predetermined register. It uses a multiplexor,
            then chooses just the answer that was actually desired. The ALU does
            four basic arithmetic functions they are, addition, subtraction,
            multiplication, and division. <br />
            <u>Control Unit</u> deals with the execution of the program stored
            in the computer’s memory. It repeatedly receives instructions and
            decodes them to determine what ought to be done, and conveys a
            proper message to the relevant unit in the system. The Control unit
            has few responsibilities to handle. CU controls sequential
            instruction execution and interpreting instruction. Guiding the data
            flow through various system areas and send receive control signals
            from system devices. Regulating and controlling processor timing.
            And fetching, decoding, execution handling, and storing results.
            <br />
            <u>Registers</u> are high-speed storage areas in the CPU. Registers
            typically consist of a small amount of fast storage. There are
            read-only and write-only registry types. Registers are used to
            quickly accept, store, and transfer data and instructions that are
            being utilized promptly by the CPU. <br /><br />
            <b>Input subsystem </b>allows the computer system to connect with
            the rest of the world. Input devices change broadly: keyboard,
            mouse, hard drive, etc. Each has various methods of communication.
            Mainly Input devices use to feed data and information into the
            computer. <br /><br /><b>Output Subsystem </b>connects the internal
            environment of a computer system to the external environment. Output
            subsystem used to, send out the data or information to an external
            party. Printers, monitors, etc. can categorize as output devices.
            <br /><br /><b>The Memory Unit </b>deals with the information,
            program, and data that the computer works on. It stores data in
            cells, typically 8 pieces in length, which are numbered
            sequentially. The memory unit should uphold two operations: fetching
            the contents of a cell when given its location, and storing a new
            value into a cell when given its location. Memory subsystems have
            main three components. Main memory, Auxiliary memory and, internal
            processor storage. <br /><br />
            <b>4.How subsystems work and perform together</b><br /><br />
            CPU, Memory unit, input system, and output subsystems are
            interconnected by a method called a bus, a set of wires through
            which they can transfer data and instruction with one another. The
            control unit is responsible for general interaction. <br />
            The central processing unit is the most critical part of any digital
            computer system. CPU is built by three main components (main memory,
            control unit, and arithmetic–logic unit). The central processing
            unit is connected to various peripheral devices. Input devices,
            output devices, and auxiliary storage units are included in this
            peripheral category. Every operation of the computer regulates and
            integrates by the control unit. It chooses and retrieves
            instructions from the main memory in a legitimate arrangement and
            interprets them in order to enact the other components of the system
            at a suitable second to perform their relevant operations. At the
            start of the operation flow, the input system comes first it feeds
            all input data to the computer system and the main memory retrieves
            all of the data and sends them into the arithmetic logic unit for
            processing, by the ALU that data being processed by basic arithmetic
            functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and
            certain logic operations like selection of the ideal problem-solving
            method or viable alternatives dependent on foreordained decision
            standards. After all that processing the processed data and
            information sends out to the output systems to output that data to
            the outside world. Above mention, all the operations are controlled
            by the control unit and for every separate operation, the
            instruction sends by the control unit via the control bus.

            <img src="images\subsystem.jpg" alt="image of subsystem" />
            In computer system architecture there is a technique used to
            communicate between subsystems. It is called the system bus, it is
            developed to reduce and improve modularity. It is a sort of a
            communication pathway.
            <img
              src="images\bus_system.jpg"
              alt="image of bussystem"
            /><br /><br />
            But it is specified by a protocol to exactly how it should be used.
            Control signals, Data signals, and address signals are the three
            type of signals pass through this system bus. According to the type
            of signal pass through, the system bus is called as the control bus,
            data bus, and address bus. But actually, there are no separate
            physical pathways for each signal type only the exact time period
            for each signal type on the same physical pathway. Control signal
            shows whether there is an address signal or a data signal pass on
            the lines at any given time. As an example, the PCI bus uses the
            same physical path for the data and address but at different time
            slots. <br />
            A program comprises a sequence of instructions that are stored in
            memory. At the point when the CPU is prepared to execute the next
            instruction in the program, the location of that instruction in
            memory is placed on the address bus. The CPU additionally put a
            “read” signal on the control bus. The memory subsystem reacts by
            setting the instruction on the data bus, where the CPU would be able
            to read it. If the CPU is instructed to read data from memory, a
            similar sequence of events takes place. <br /><br />
            <img src="images\bus.png" alt="image of bus" /><br /><br />
            <b>5.Memory Subsystem</b><br /><br />
            Any system to work its need data and instruction. To store that data
            and instruction system needs a place, we call it the Memory or
            memory subsystem. These data and instructions have been given a
            different priority level according to how important they are to run
            the system. Some data are critical and need to be accessed quickly
            to run the system while some are not. According to their importance,
            they have different storage areas. These storage areas can be dived
            into three main locations.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p style="margin-left: 35px">
            • Internal Processor storage <br />
            • Primary memory <br />
            • Secondary memory
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            Internal Processor storage stores the most critical data and
            instructions to the system. Since they needed to access fast as
            possible they are located inside the processing unit. That way CPU
            can access them quickly. Internal processor storage has two storage
            components.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p style="margin-left: 35px">
            • Cache memory <br />
            • Registers <br />
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <u>Cache memory </u>is placed between main memory and CPU. When the
            system runs there is a synchronizing between CPU and main memory,
            caches responsible to speed up this synchronization. It performs as
            a buffer between main memory and CPU. Cache memories are faster than
            the main memory and economical than CPU registers. Cache memory
            store frequently requested data and instruction within it and save
            time from receiving that data from main memory. There are three
            different independent cache memories: level 1cache, level 2cache,
            and level 3cache. Level 1 cache is much closer to the CPU and the
            fastest one. <br />
            <u>Registers</u>are the fastest memory unit in the system and built
            into the processor itself. It helps to CPU to access them directly.
            It holds instruction, address, and data that are around 32-bits to
            64-bits. There are different register types.

          <p>
            <b>Primary Memory </b><br />
            The primary memory is the place where information and instructions
            are stored, so they can be accessed straight by the CPU. The two
            main kinds of main memory are Random access memory(RAM) and Read
            only memory(ROM). Storage can divide into two according to their
            data maintenance capability when power off. The volatile memories
            lose their data after a power-off while the non-volatile memories
            are able to secure their data after a power-off. RAM is a volatile
            memory but ROM is a non-volatile memory. <br /><br />
            <b>RAM</b><br />
            RAM is the component in a computer system where the application
            programs, data in current use, and operating system are kept so they
            can be accessed by the processor. Ram is the main memory of the
            computer system because it is much faster for reading and writing
            than other kinds of large storages, such as hard disk drive(HDD),
            solid state drive(SSD), or optical drive. RAM is a short term memory
            because of its volatility. RAM can’t store permanent data. It is
            getting refresh when the power goes off. Name “random” was given to
            this device is because any piece of data stored in this device can
            directly be accessed. To archive, this RAM uses a cell array method.
            It has cells that are arranged according to a column across rows,
            each cell has its own unique address. To find a specific cell, the
            controller sends the unique address down. RAM has two primary forms:
            <br />
            <u>Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM)</u>, every DRAM cell has
            charge or absence of charge held in an electrical capacitor. This
            data should be continually received with an electronic charge each
            couple of milliseconds to make up for leaks from the capacitor. A
            semiconductor serves as a door, determining if a capacitor’s value
            can be read or written. DRAM is the most used RAM type. Relatively
            slower and less expensive. <br />
            <u>Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) </u>also needs uninterrupted
            power to hold on to data but doesn’t want to be refresh continuously
            as the DRAM. In SRAM rather than a capacitor holding the charge, the
            transistor goes about as a switch, with one position filling in as 1
            and the other position as 0. SRAM requires a few transistors to hold
            the slightest bit of information contrasted with DRAM which needs
            just a single transistor for every bit. Accordingly, SRAM chips are
            a lot bigger and more costly than a comparable measure of DRAM.
            <br /><br />
            <b>ROM</b><br />
            ROM(Read Only Memory) is the component that can hold its data
            permanently or semi-permanently. Even after a system power down it
            can hold its data. ROM is used to save the most important
            information like boot-up instruction, hardware diagnostics, loading
            operating system to RAM, etc. The basic mode of the ROM is not
            writable you can only read it. But there is a variety of ROMs that
            can writable. <br />
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 35px">
            • PROM (programmable ROM) – capable of being programmed once after
            has been created and not allowed to change after programmed. <br />
            • EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM) – If needed can expose to
            ultraviolet light and reprogrammed, but otherwise does not accept or
            save any new data. <br />
            • EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM) – can be erased
            and reprogrammed using an electrical charge that was developed from
            EEPROM.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <p><b>RAM vs ROM</b></p>
          <br />
          <p style="margin-left: 35px">
            # RAM is volatile whereas ROM is non-Volatile <br />
            # RAM stored the information that needs to run the computer while
            ROM data is used to start up the process of the computer. <br />
            # ROM is fast and small in capacity compared to RAM.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <p><b>Secondary Memory</b></p>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            Secondary memories are non-volatile and can store data permanently.
            Also, these memories can use as input devices and output devices.
            Comparing to other memory types in the memory subsystem these are
            larger in capacity but slower than the others. Can use to overcome
            the capacity limitations of primary storage. Cheaper than the other
            storage types, when considering the cost per bit. Also called as
            auxiliary memory. Examples- Hard disk, Optical Disk, Floppy Disk,
            DVD, etc. <br /><br />
            <u>Advantages</u>
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 35px">
            1. Large incapacity <br />
            2. Less expensive <br />
            3. Non-volatile <br />
            4. Reliable and permanent
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <p><u>Disadvantages</u></p>
          <br />
          <p style="margin-left: 35px">
            1. Much slower than other types. <br />
            2. Not directly accessible for CPU. <br />
            3. Uses electromagnetic technology.
          </p>
          <br /><br /><br />
          <p>
            <b>Memory Hierarchy</b><br /><br />
            In the computer system, architecture storage units are divided into
            different levels based on their response time, and it is called
            memory hierarchy.
